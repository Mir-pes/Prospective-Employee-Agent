# Prospective-Employee-Agent

The Prospective Employee Agent is an AI-powered, agentic system designed to assist in interacting with prospective employees.
It leverages LangChain concepts to orchestrate intelligent agents that can analyze inputs, reason step-by-step, and provide structured outputs useful for internal hiring or evaluation workflows.

This project is intended for internal or experimental use, not for direct public-facing deployment.

# Core Concepts Used

- Agentic Architecture (decision-making agents, not just prompts) using LangGraph

- LangChain Framework

- LLM-powered reasoning

- Modular and extensible design
